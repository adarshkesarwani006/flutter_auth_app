If not, please use this link to configure all these essential things in your machine "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFDbZk2xhO4", or you can choose any other tutorial available on the web according to your convenience.
2. Download the Zip Folder "https://github.com/adarshkesarwani006/flutter_auth_app" on your machine.
3. Open it on any IDE most preferably Android Studio but Visual code will also work, I have used Android Studio.
4. Use this tutorial to setup your physical device to run the application "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LL1lCFoev0" or you can use virtual device also.
5. After successfully configuring above steps, oper terminal in Android Studio and run below command one by one:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get 👈
    ```
    ```bash
    flutter run 👈
    ```
    This will configure all the dependencies used in this flutter application.
6. To run this application you have to connect Firebase CLI also: Refer this video to connect it "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4iXqsDKqAM"
7. Now as this application is running on my Firebase Account, So you have to configure your account and new project in firebase and then connect it to this flutter app using SHA-1 key: refer this video-> "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok6se5sOthw"
8. Hit the run/build button of Android Studio (green triangle), and voilà!🎉 You have your Flutter application.

**Note:** After completing all these steps, If it compiles successfully, congratulations!'🎉 You're now a Flutter developer. However, if it doesn't compile, you'll need to debug it extensively. Application development involves many procedures and processes, and its dependencies on the machine environment can make it challenging to predict all potential issues and their solutions. 
I have attempted to provide reference videos for smooth configuration and installation of the app. The major areas of concern include Flutter installation, getting dependencies, connecting to Firebase, and setting up AVD/Physical Device. Minor debugging may still be required. If you encounter any major issues, please connect with me.
